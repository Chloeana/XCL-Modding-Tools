## Playable Character

The **Playable Character** tab is designed for creating a fully fleshed-out character mod. This tool provides fields for:

- **Character Information**: Personal information like name and body measurements.
- **Descriptions**: Provide descriptions that will appear in-game, like physical appearance changes or mirror thoughts.
- **Media Locations and Counts**: Specify the location and quantity of character media.

When all fields are complete, you can generate a `.twee` file containing the character data, along with media directories structured for easy integration into the game.

## Positions

The **Positions** tab is dedicated to configuring bedroom positions related to your character. The fields allow you to define one position at a time. 

1. Fill in the fields with attributes about a position, then click **Add Position** to add it to the list.
2. When finished, generate a **Positions file**.

You can also import an existing file to edit or build upon prior work.

## Outfits

The **Outfits** tab works similarly to the Positions tab, but for configuring your character’s wardrobe. Each outfit has its own fields:

1. Complete the fields to define a single outfit and click **Add Outfit**.
2. After adding all desired outfits to the list, generate an **Outfits file**.

As with Positions, you can import an existing file if you want to modify or extend a pre-existing list of outfits.

## BLACKED Expansion

The **BLACKED** tab allows you to create additional content for an existing playable character. This tool is primarily focused on media additions, so there’s no need to repeat character details or dialogs.

- Fields in this tab apply specifically to the BLACKED content, focusing on new media tagging and categorization.

Like the Playable Character tab, this tool also generates a `.twee` file for easy integration.

## Bar Girl

The **Bar Girl** tab is for creating a **non-playable character** (NPC) that your playable character will interact with at the bar. Fields in this tab include:

- **Character Information**: General characteristics of the NPC.
- **Personality Traits**: Select traits that influence in-game interactions.
- **Scene Descriptions**: Define scenes related to this character.

Once complete, this tab will generate a `.twee` file for the new bar girl NPC, ready for inclusion in your mod.

## Meta Maker

The **Meta Maker** tab allows for creating standalone `.meta` files, which store metadata for your mods. Each of the other tabs has a section for meta information, but this tab enables you to create or update meta data independently. 

- If you need to update or create a meta file without revisiting your playable character’s mod configuration, use this tool to create a **Meta file** directly.
